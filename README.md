# Learning WordPress

🦆 I've been reluctant to use this tool, but finally I gave in.

## Using this repo

### After clone

- `composer install`
- Copy `.env-sample` to `.env` and change to your preferences.
- `docker-compose up` to start a MySQL server.
- `php -S localhost:8000 -t wordpress/` to start a Web server.
